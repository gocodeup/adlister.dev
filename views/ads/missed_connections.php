                <p class="lead">Every time I see you I feel as if I can't speak. I want to talk to you but I get so shy.</p>
                <p>I have no problem speaking with any other coworkers but you leave me breathless. You're twice my age but I don't care. You're so handsome and you dress so nice.</p>
                <p> I've heard you're married and I've also heard you're divorced if its the latter I'd love to speak more and get to know each other. ;) </p>
                <p>The way you speak and your smile keep me hypnotized. Recently I've been wanting to see what its like with an older professional and I think you'd be my perfect first.</p>
